# System Requirements

Let's get started with some system requirements for running ContentBox sites:

## Java

ContentBox will run in any Java 1.7+ enabled servlet container as a WAR or self-contained express edition.

## ColdFusion \(CFML\) Engine

ContentBox source can be also be deployed to the following ColdFusion CFML engines:

* Adobe ColdFusion 11+
* Lucee 4.5+

## Databases

ContentBox can run on any database engine that Hibernate ORM supports \([https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/SupportedDatabases2](https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/SupportedDatabases2)\), but we officially support the following:

* MySQL 5+ \(InnoDB ONLY!\)
* Microsoft SQL Server 2008+
* Oracle 11g+
* Hypersonic
* H2
* Apache Derby
* PostgreSQL \(Experimental\)

If you have another database engine that needs ContentBox support, please let us know and we will be able to help you \([https://www.ortussolutions.com/contact](https://www.ortussolutions.com/contact)\).

### IMPORTANT: Dialect Choice

We would highly recommend that you choose the dialect of choice for your database via the `Application.cfc` in ContentBox. This would avoid your pains and headaches as sometimes Hibernate will not detect the database correctly. The available dialects can be found here: [https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/developing-applications/coldfusion-orm/configure-orm/orm-settings.html](https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/developing-applications/coldfusion-orm/configure-orm/orm-settings.html).

**Example Code**

```javascript
this.ormsettings = {
    dialect = "MicrosoftSQLServer
};
```

**Dialects We Support**

* `Derby`
* `PostgreSQL`
* `MySQL`
* `MySQLwithInnoDB`
* `MySQLwithMyISAM`
* `Oracle10g`
* `MicrosoftSQLServer`

{% hint style="success" %}
**Tip:** If you are using the H2 or Hypersonic Databases, just leave the dialect empty or use the **MySQL** dialects for compatibility purposes.
{% endhint %}

### MSSQL Caveats

If you are running an MSSQL server then we would recommend you update the `Application.cfc` with the ORM dialect for MSSQL. We have seen many weird dialect issues with MSSQL if this is not done:

```javascript
this.ormsettings = {
    dialect = "MicrosoftSQLServer
};
```

We have also seen an issue where an error will be reported that `cbPermission` cannot be inserted. This is an issue where for some reason the JDBC driver will switch context and create the tables in the `master` schema and not the schema you chose. So please verify that the `master` schema has tables that start with `cb_*` and remove them and re-run the installer.

### MySQL Caveats

If you are running MySQL server with `MyISAM` as your default table engine, you will need to either make the default `InnoDB` or use the `InnoDB` dialect. You can do this by adding a dialect section to the ORM settings in the `Application.cfc`: `dialect = "MySQLWithInnoDB"`

```javascript
this.ormsettings = {
    dialect = "MySQLWithInnoDB
};
```

### PostgreSQL Caveats

We have seen some issues on some versions of PostgreSQL where Boolean values of numerical `1` and `0` are not been translated correctly. If this is the case in your version of PostgreSQL you will see some `cannot cast Boolean to Integer` exceptions. If this is the case please contact us and we will show you how to update your installation to allow for these conversions.

## URL Rewriting

ContentBox relies on Search Engine Safe \(SES\) URLs and URL Routing. The majority of CFML engines already allow for these types of URLs out of the box and ContentBox supports it out of the box. However, if you would like to use full URL rewriting \(which we recommend, that's where the `index.cfm` is not showing in the URLs\) you will need to use a web server rewriting tool and ContentBox will configure it for you. So before you install Contentbox make sure that you are using one of the supported rewriting engines show below:

* CommandBox Server
* Apache mod\_rewrite
* IIS 7 rewrite module
* Tuckey rewrite filter
* Nginx

The ContentBox installer will create rewrite files automatically for you for Apache, IIS7, and express editions. For Nginx or other rewrite engines, you will need to add the rewrites yourself and then manually modify the routing file.

### ContentBox 4.0+

Edit `config/Router.cfc` and set `setFullRewrites` to `true`. That's it!

```javascript
function configure(){
    // Configuration
    setValidExtensions( 'xml,json,jsont,rss,html,htm,cfm,print,pdf,doc,txt' );
    // Process Full Rewrites then true, else false and an `index.cfm` will always be included in URLs
    setFullRewrites( true );

    // Mappings
    route( ":handler/:action" ).end();
}
```

### Older Versions of ContentBox

Edit `config/routes.cfm` and remove any reference to `index.cfm`. That's it!

```javascript
// Base URL
if( len(getSetting('AppMapping') ) lte 1){
    // Remove the index.cfm
    setBaseURL("http://#cgi.HTTP_HOST##getContextRoot()#/index.cfm");
} else {
    // Remove the index.cfm
    setBaseURL("http://#cgi.HTTP_HOST##getContextRoot()#/#getSetting('AppMapping')#/index.cfm");
}
```

## File Permissions

ContentBox needs some files/folders to be writable at runtime. We use this for our installer, ForgeBox cloud deployments, auto-updates, and more. The following directories need read/write permissions for the installer only to work:

### Installer

```text
{Root}/Application.cfc
{Root}/config/ColdBox.cfc
{Root}/coldbox/system/aop/tmp
```

### Engine

Here are the folders for the core engine to work accordingly

```text
# Engine Operation (REQUIRED)
{Root}/coldbox/system/aop/tmp

# Media Manager
{Root}/modules_app/contentbox-custom/content

# Auto-udpates
{Root}/modules/contentbox/updates

# If you want ForgeBox enabled downloads
{Root}/modules_app/contentbox-custom/_modules
{Root}/modules_app/contentbox-custom/_themes
{Root}/modules_app/contentbox-custom/_widgets
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Danger:** If you will not be using any ForgeBox download deployments then you do not need to enable write permissions for `themes, modules, and widgets in your custom module.`
{% endhint %}
